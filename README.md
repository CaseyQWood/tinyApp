## Notes from the Developer

- Commenting is styled so that pages and their functionality are seperated by a beginning comment and a end comment in all caps outlining its general block
- all other commenting follows pretty standard reasoning. typically each .get and .post in the server file will have a comment regarding its specific functionality
- included will be a test file for helper functions that uses Both mocha and Chai. If you have them installed npm test will run included tests
